Ex 44.

Given a list of integer numbers, find the range of the list (the maximum - minimum value)

Program description: The objective of this program is to try and solve logical problems using code.
The code specifically asks to return the range of a given list of numbers.
You first have to try and get the maximum value, then the minimum value and then find and return the range.


Hint: Range = Max value â€“ Min value
