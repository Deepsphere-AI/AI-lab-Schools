Create a function that sorts a list. Use the sorted() function which will sort a list alphaetically


Program description: The objective of this program is to create a simple user-defined function that takes in an input from the user 
of the program and performs a variety of arithmetic functions on it before returning the final answer. This program imitates a 4 
function calculator. Here the user can input the two numbers and their preferred arithmetic operation (addition or subtraction).
Remember: Unless a function is called, python will not perform the code under the specific function. Hence, function calls are very important. 
Try to differentiate between arguments and parameters of a function.
