Create a function that sorts a list. Use the sorted() function which will sort a list alphaetically


Program description: 
Program description: The objective of this program is to create a function which uses the Python’s inbuilt functions.
This program specifically uses sorted() functions to sort a list in the alphabetical order. It then returns the sorted list.
Remember: Built-in functions are those that are already defined in Python libraries and we can call them directly.
User defined functions are those that we define ourselves in our program using the ‘def’ keyword and then call them wherever we want.
