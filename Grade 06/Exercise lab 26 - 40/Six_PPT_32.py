Ex 32.

Now we are starting functions. Using the keyword def, create a basing function called add that does not take anything in, nor returns anything.

Program description: The objective of this program is to start with an introduction to functions.
You can learn how to create user-defined functions using the keyword ‘def’.
The function does not take anything nor return anything. This program specifically prints out a blank line when called.
Remember: A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
