Create a function that takes in a number and prints out all the numbers under it

Hint: for x in ___

Program description: The objective of this program is to create a simple user-defined function that combines both the knowledge of for loops and functions.
This program specifically takes in a number and prints out all the numbers lesser than him.
Remember: Indentation is extremely important in Python. Not indenting code that is supposed to come under a function properly will cause an error.
