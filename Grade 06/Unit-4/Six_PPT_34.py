Ex 34.

Create another function, subtract that does the opposite of add and subtracts the two numbers passed in.

Program description: The objective of this program is to create a simple user-defined function that takes in 2 parameters and print out its difference.
If you do not provide two numbers when calling the function, there will be an error.
Notice: Isnâ€™t this program and the program before this, similar to Ex. 31? Then why do we need functions?
