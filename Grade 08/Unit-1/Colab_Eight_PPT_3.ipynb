Here we declare a variable “x” and initialize it as 0 and give it with a while condition that the value should be lesser than 10.and we also increment which is increasing the value of x by 1, each time the loop runs. And we print so each time the loop runs it will increase its value by 1 and check with the condition and if the condition satisfies its proceeds or if not, the loop terminates.\n",
