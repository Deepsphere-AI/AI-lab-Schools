Similar to past question, but write a while loop to print out the counting numbers from 10-20

Program description: In this program we are going to print the numbers in the range using while statements. 
Here we declare a variable ‘x’and initialize it as 10 and give it with a while condition that the value 
should be lesser than21 and we also increment which is increasing the value of x by 1, each time the loop runs. 
And we print so each time the loop runs it will increase its value by 1 and check with e condition and if the
condition satisfies its proceeds or if not, the loops terminates.
NOTE: THE VALUE CAN ALSO DECREMENT BY USING THE CONDITION X=X-1

vAR_x = 10
while vAR_x < 21:
  print(vAR_x)
  vAR_x+=1    
  
  #Or vAR_x = vAR_x+1 also works
