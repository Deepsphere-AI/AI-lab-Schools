Ex 2.

Create 2 variables, time1 and time2 and print the greater variable

Hint: Use if(): and else:
Program description: The objective of this program is to print the greatest value of the particular data type of both the variables.
In this program we will be declaring two variables” time1” and “time2”and will initialize integer value to both the variables ie:10 and 15 respectively. 
And using the looping statement ifelse we will be checking if value of time1 is greater than time 2 so the condition is if time1 is greater than time2
then print time1 is greater if the condition is not satisfied then we move to the else statement and print that statement
NOTE: FOR COMPARISION BETWEEN TWO VARIABLES THE DATA TYPE OF BOTH THE VALUES OF THE INTEAGER SHOULD BE HOMOGENEOUS.
